A Gate is a lightweight library you embed in your service to verify Passports and make allow/deny decisions.

## How Gates Work

1. Agent presents a Passport with its request
2. Gate verifies the cryptographic signature
3. Gate checks permissions against the requested action/resource
4. Gate returns an allow/deny decision

All of this happens **locally** — no network calls required.

## Basic Usage

```python
from uniplex import Gate

gate = Gate(profile="L1")

decision = gate.check(
    passport=passport,
    action="read",
    resource="file:config.txt"
)

if decision.allowed:
    # Proceed
    pass
else:
    print(f"Denied: {decision.reason}")
```

## Decision Object

The `decision` returned by `gate.check()` contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `allowed` | bool | Whether the action is permitted |
| `reason` | string | Reason code if denied |
| `attestation` | object | Signed proof of the decision (optional) |

## Trust Profiles

Gates operate at one of three trust levels:

```python
# Development/testing
gate = Gate(profile="L1")

# Production
gate = Gate(profile="L2")

# High assurance
gate = Gate(profile="L3")
```

See [Trust Profiles](/concepts/trust-profiles) for details on each level.

## Configuration

```python
gate = Gate(
    profile="L2",
    allowed_issuers=["issuer:acme", "issuer:partner"],
    revocation_policy="fail_closed"
)
```
