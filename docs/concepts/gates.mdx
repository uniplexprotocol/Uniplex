A Gate is a lightweight library you embed in your service to verify Passports and make allow/deny decisions.

## How Gates Work

1. Agent presents a Passport with its request
2. Gate verifies the cryptographic signature
3. Gate checks permissions against the requested action/resource
4. Gate returns an allow/deny decision

All of this happens **locally** — no network calls required.

## Basic Usage

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from uniplex import Gate, TrustProfile

gate = Gate(profile=TrustProfile.L1)

decision = gate.authorize_simple(
    passport=passport,
    action="read"
)

if decision.allowed:
    # Proceed
    pass
else:
    print(f"Denied: {decision.reason_code}")
```
```typescript TypeScript
import { Gate, TrustProfile } from 'uniplex';

const gate = new Gate({ profile: TrustProfile.L1 });

const decision = await gate.authorizeSimple(passport, 'read');

if (decision.allowed) {
  // Proceed
} else {
  console.log(`Denied: ${decision.reasonCode}`);
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Decision Object

The decision returned by the gate contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `allowed` | bool | Whether the action is permitted |
| `reasonCode` | string | Reason code if denied |
| `passportId` | string | ID of the passport that was checked |
| `agentId` | string | ID of the agent |

## Trust Profiles

Gates operate at one of three trust levels:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from uniplex import Gate, TrustProfile

# Development/testing
gate = Gate(profile=TrustProfile.L1)

# Production
gate = Gate(profile=TrustProfile.L2)

# High assurance
gate = Gate(profile=TrustProfile.L3)
```
```typescript TypeScript
import { Gate, TrustProfile } from 'uniplex';

// Development/testing
const gate = new Gate({ profile: TrustProfile.L1 });

// Production
const gate = new Gate({ profile: TrustProfile.L2 });

// High assurance
const gate = new Gate({ profile: TrustProfile.L3 });
```
</CodeGroup>

See [Trust Profiles](/concepts/trust-profiles) for details on each level.

## Configuration

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from uniplex import Gate, TrustProfile

gate = Gate(
    profile=TrustProfile.L2,
    policy={
        "allow_self_issued": False,
        "allowed_issuers": ["issuer:acme", "issuer:partner"]
    }
)
```
```typescript TypeScript
import { Gate, TrustProfile } from 'uniplex';

const gate = new Gate({
  profile: TrustProfile.L2,
  policy: {
    allowSelfIssued: false,
    allowedIssuers: ['issuer:acme', 'issuer:partner']
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>
