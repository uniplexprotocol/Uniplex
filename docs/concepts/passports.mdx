# Passports

A Passport is a signed credential that an AI agent carries to prove its identity and permissions.

## What's in a Passport?

A Passport contains:

- **Identity** — What the agent is (agent ID, type, metadata)
- **Issuer** — Who vouches for the agent (self-issued, enterprise, or certified)
- **Permissions** — What the agent is allowed to do (action + resource + constraints)
- **Proof** — Cryptographic signature proving authenticity

## Example Passport

```json
{
  "uni_version": "2026-01-24",
  "identity": {
    "id": "agent:my-agent",
    "type": "assistant"
  },
  "permissions": [
    {
      "action": "read",
      "resource": "file:*.txt"
    }
  ],
  "provenance": {
    "issuer": {
      "id": "issuer:acme",
      "tier": "verified"
    },
    "issued_at": "2026-01-24T00:00:00Z",
    "expires_at": "2026-01-25T00:00:00Z"
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519",
    "signature": "..."
  }
}
```

## Issuer Tiers

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **self** | Agent issued its own passport (dev/test only) |
| **enterprise** | Issued by an internal/organizational authority |
| **verified** | Issued by a verified third-party |
| **certified** | Issued by a certified authority |

## Creating Passports

```python
from uniplex import Passport

# Self-issued (L1 only)
passport = Passport.create_self_issued(
    agent_id="my-agent",
    permissions=[{"action": "read", "resource": "file:*.txt"}],
    ttl_hours=24
)

# With an issuer (L2/L3)
passport = Passport.create(
    agent_id="my-agent",
    permissions=[{"action": "read", "resource": "file:*.txt"}],
    issuer=issuer,  # Your issuer instance
    ttl_hours=24
)
```
