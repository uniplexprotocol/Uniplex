Get up and running with Uniplex in minutes.

## Installation

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install uniplex
```
</CodeGroup>

## Create a Self-Issued Passport (L1)

<Note>
L1/self-issued passports are intended for dev/test and low-risk reads. For production, use L2/L3 with trusted issuer policy and theft/replay protections.
</Note>

```python
from uniplex import Passport

passport = Passport.create_self_issued(
    agent_id="my-agent",
    permissions=[
        {"action": "read", "resource": "file:*.txt"}
    ],
    ttl_hours=24
)
```

## Verify at a Gate

`Gate.check` accepts a `Passport` object or a base64-encoded passport string.

```python
from uniplex import Gate

# L1 is dev/test only; use L2/L3 in production
gate = Gate(profile="L1")

decision = gate.check(
    passport=passport,
    action="read",
    resource="file:config.txt"
)

if decision.allowed:
    # Proceed with operation
    pass
else:
    print(f"Denied: {decision.reason}")
```

## MCP Integration

```python
from uniplex import Gate

# L2 requires a trusted issuer policy — configure your Gate with allowed issuers
gate = Gate(profile="L2")

@mcp_server.tool()
def charge_card(card_id: str, amount: int, passport_b64: str):
    decision = gate.check(
        passport=passport_b64,
        action="payments.charge",
        resource=f"card:{card_id}"
    )

    if not decision.allowed:
        raise PermissionError(f"Denied: {decision.reason}")

    return {"status": "ok", "charged": amount}
```
