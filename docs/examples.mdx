Real-world examples showing Uniplex in action.

## Payments API

**The high-stakes demo.** AI agents accessing a banking API with:

- Amount limits (agents have transfer caps)
- Account isolation (agents can only access their owner's accounts)
- Permission scoping (read-only vs transfer)
- Audit trail with signed attestations

| What's Blocked | Why |
|----------------|-----|
| Agent tries \$500 transfer with \$100 limit | Exceeds permission |
| Alice's agent accessing Bob's account | Wrong owner |
| Read-only agent transferring \$1 | No transfer permission |
| Agent tries \$50k transfer with \$10k limit | Exceeds permission |

**Total prevented: \$50,551 in unauthorized transfers**

  Server, client, and full README
</Card>

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uniplexprotocol/Uniplex.git
cd Uniplex/examples/payments
npm install
```

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
npm run server
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
npm run client
```

### How It Works

**Create an agent with transfer limits:**

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from uniplex import Agent

# Agent can only transfer up to $100
agent = Agent.create('alice-assistant', 
    permissions=[
        'payments:read_balance',
        'payments:transfer:100'
    ]
)
```
```typescript TypeScript
import { Agent } from 'uniplex';

// Agent can only transfer up to $100
const agent = await Agent.create('alice-assistant', {
  permissions: [
    'payments:read_balance',
    'payments:transfer:100'
  ]
});
```
</CodeGroup>

**Server checks permissions before executing:**

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from uniplex import Gate, TrustProfile

gate = Gate(profile=TrustProfile.L1)

def transfer(passport, amount):
    decision = gate.authorize_simple(passport, f'payments:transfer:{amount}')
    
    if not decision.allowed:
        raise PermissionError(f"Denied: {decision.reason_code}")
    
    # Safe to execute transfer
```
```typescript TypeScript
import { Gate, TrustProfile } from 'uniplex';

const gate = new Gate({ profile: TrustProfile.L1 });

async function transfer(passport, amount) {
  const decision = await gate.authorizeSimple(
    passport, 
    `payments:transfer:${amount}`
  );
  
  if (!decision.allowed) {
    throw new Error(`Denied: ${decision.reasonCode}`);
  }
  
  // Safe to execute transfer
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Sample Output
```
→ Checking Alice's balance...
  ✅ Balance: $5,000.00
  📜 Attestation: att_00170b44ed4c

→ Transferring $50 to Bob...
  ✅ Transfer complete! New balance: $4,950.00
  📜 Attestation: att_e88ae479d429

→ Attempting $500 transfer (SHOULD FAIL)...
  🚫 DENIED: Transfer amount $500 exceeds your limit of $100
     Your limit: $100, Requested: $500
```
