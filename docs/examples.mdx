Real-world examples showing Uniplex in action.

## Payments API

**The high-stakes demo.** AI agents accessing a banking API with:

- Amount limits ($100 vs $10,000 transfer caps)
- Account isolation (agents can only access their owner's accounts)
- Permission scoping (read-only vs transfer)
- Audit trail with signed attestations

| What's Blocked | Why |
|----------------|-----|
| $500 transfer with $100 limit | Exceeds permission |
| Alice's agent accessing Bob's account | Wrong owner |
| Read-only agent transferring $1 | No transfer permission |
| $50k transfer with $10k limit | Exceeds permission |

**Total prevented: $50,551 in unauthorized transfers**
