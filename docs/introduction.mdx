# Uniplex

**The trust layer for AI agents.**

Uniplex is an open protocol that provides verifiable identity and scoped authorization for AI agents. Whether you're building MCP servers, agent frameworks, or internal tools, Uniplex provides a standardized way to verify what an agent is and what it's allowed to do.

## What is Uniplex?

Uniplex is a passport system for AI agents. It enables:

- **Passports** — Agents carry signed credentials that prove what they are, who issued them, and what they're allowed to do
- **Gates** — Any tool can verify passports locally and make an allow/deny decision
- **Trust Profiles** — Scale from L1 (dev/test) to L2 (production) to L3 (strict)

## Key Benefits

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Local-First" icon="bolt">
    No network calls in the hot path. Verification happens locally in sub-millisecond time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pluggable" icon="plug">
    Works alongside your existing auth (API keys, OAuth/JWT, mTLS). No rip-and-replace.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Vendor-Neutral" icon="scale-balanced">
    Not tied to any model provider. Works with any agent framework, model, or tool stack.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open Protocol" icon="lock-open">
    Apache-2.0 licensed. No vendor lock-in.

## How It Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant I as Issuer
    participant A as Agent
    participant G as Gate

    I->>A: Issues Passport (credentials + scoped permissions)
    A->>G: Request + Passport
    G->>G: Verify signature & check policy (L1/L2/L3)
    G->>A: Allow/Deny + Attestation
```

**Key insight:** Verification happens locally at the Gate — no round-trip to a central server for every tool call.
