# Uniplex is a Passport System for AI Agents.

AI agents are calling APIs and taking actions with no standard way to verify they're authorized. Uniplex is an open protocol that adds a lightweight trust layer for the agentic web.

## Why Uniplex?

- **Passports** — Agents carry signed credentials that prove what they are, who issued them, and what they're allowed to do
- **Gates** — Any tool—MCP servers, APIs, or agent tool calls—can verify passports locally and make an allow/deny decision
- **Pluggable** — Works alongside your existing auth (API keys, OAuth/JWT, mTLS). No rip-and-replace.
- **Local-First** — No network calls in the hot path. No shared secrets.
- **Security Tiers** — L1 (dev) → L2 (production) → L3 (strict)
- **Vendor-Neutral** — Works with any agent framework, model, or tool stack

## How It Works
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant I as Issuer
    participant A as Agent
    participant G as Gate

    I->>A: Issues Passport (credentials + scoped permissions)
    A->>G: Request + Passport
    G->>G: Verify signature & check policy (L1/L2/L3)
    G->>A: Allow/Deny + Attestation
```

**Key insight:** Verification happens locally at the Gate — no round-trip to a central server for every tool call.
