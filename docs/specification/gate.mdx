title: Gate Algorithm
description: "Verification and decision logic"
---

A Gate is the verification point that checks Passports and makes allow/deny decisions.

## L1 Baseline Algorithm

Every Gate MUST implement these checks in order:
```
1. Verify passport signature         (embedded public_key)
2. Check passport not expired        (timestamp comparison)
3. Apply issuer policy               (allow_self_issued OR issuer in allowlist)
4. Check permission exists           (action matches permissions[])
5. Return allow/deny
```

## Request Format
```json
{
  "uni_version": "2026-01-25",
  "request_id": "req_abc123",
  "passport": { "...passport object..." },
  "action": "mcp:search",
  "target": "mcp://tools.example.com",
  "issued_at": "2026-01-25T12:00:00Z",
  "parameters": { "query": "weather" }
}
```

## Decision Format
```json
{
  "uni_version": "2026-01-25",
  "request_id": "req_abc123",
  "decision": "allow",
  "decision_at": "2026-01-25T12:00:01Z",
  "passport_id": "uni_abc123",
  "agent_id": "agent:my-agent",
  "action": "mcp:search"
}
```

## Denial Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | Passport signature verification failed |
| `PASSPORT_EXPIRED` | Passport has expired |
| `ISSUER_NOT_ALLOWED` | Issuer not trusted by this gate |
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | Action not in permissions |
| `POP_REQUIRED` | L2+ requires Proof of Possession |
| `POP_INVALID` | PoP verification failed |

## SDK Usage
```python
from uniplex import Gate, GateRequest, TrustProfile

gate = Gate(profile=TrustProfile.L1)

request = GateRequest.create(
    passport=passport,
    action="mcp:search",
    target="mcp://tools.example.com"
)

decision = gate.authorize(request)

if decision.allowed:
    # proceed
```
