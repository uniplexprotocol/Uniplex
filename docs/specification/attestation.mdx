title: Attestation Format
description: "Portable proof of authorization"
---

An Attestation is a signed record of an authorization decision. It provides non-repudiable proof that a check occurred.

## Schema
```json
{
  "uni_version": "2026-01-25",
  "attestation_id": "att_abc123",
  "request_id": "req_abc123",
  "passport_id": "uni_abc123",
  "agent_id": "agent:my-agent",
  "action": "mcp:search",
  "target": "mcp://tools.example.com",
  "decision": "allow",
  "reason_code": null,
  "created_at": "2026-01-25T12:00:01Z",
  "gate_id": "gate:prod-1",
  "public_key": "base64...",
  "signature": "base64..."
}
```

## Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `attestation_id` | string | ✓ | Unique identifier |
| `request_id` | string | ✓ | Original request ID |
| `passport_id` | string | ✓ | Passport that was checked |
| `agent_id` | string | ✓ | Agent that made the request |
| `action` | string | ✓ | Action that was authorized |
| `decision` | string | ✓ | "allow" or "deny" |
| `reason_code` | string | | Denial reason (if denied) |

| `gate_id` | string | | Which gate made the decision |
| `signature` | string | ✓ | Signature over canonical JSON |

## Use Cases

- **Audit trails**: Prove exactly what was authorized, when, by whom
- **Compliance**: Show auditors signed evidence of access control
- **Debugging**: Trace why an action was allowed or denied
- **Billing**: Prove service was authorized before charging

## SDK Usage

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from uniplex import Attestation

attestation = Attestation.from_decision(request, decision, gate_id="my-gate")

# Verify later
assert attestation.verify_signature() == True

# Export for storage
json_str = attestation.to_json()
```
```typescript TypeScript
import { Attestation } from 'uniplex';

const attestation = await Attestation.fromDecision(request, decision, {
  gateId: 'my-gate'
});

// Verify later
await attestation.verifySignature();  // true

// Export for storage
const json = attestation.toJson();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Creating from Gate Decision

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from uniplex import Gate, GateRequest, Attestation, TrustProfile

gate = Gate(profile=TrustProfile.L1)
request = GateRequest.create(passport, action="mcp:search")
decision = gate.authorize(request)

# Create attestation from the decision
attestation = Attestation.from_decision(request, decision, gate_id="prod-gate-1")
```
```typescript TypeScript
import { Gate, GateRequest, Attestation, TrustProfile } from 'uniplex';

const gate = new Gate({ profile: TrustProfile.L1 });
const request = GateRequest.create(passport, 'mcp:search');
const decision = await gate.authorize(request);

// Create attestation from the decision
const attestation = await Attestation.fromDecision(request, decision, {
  gateId: 'prod-gate-1'
});
```
