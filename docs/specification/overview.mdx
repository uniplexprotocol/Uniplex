**The trust layer for AI agents.**

Uniplex is an open protocol that provides verifiable identity and scoped authorization for AI agents. Whether you're building MCP servers, agent frameworks, or internal tools, Uniplex provides a standardized way to verify what an agent is and what it's allowed to do.

## Version

**Specification Version:** 2026-01-25

**Status:** Initial Release

## Terminology

This specification follows [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) terminology.

## Overview

Uniplex enables any tool or service to:

- Verify agent identity via signed credentials (Passports)
- Make local allow/deny decisions (Gates)
- Prove authorization for audit trails (Attestations)

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Passport** | Signed credential carrying identity + scoped permissions |
| **Gate** | Verification logic at tool boundaries |
| **Attestation** | Signed proof of authorization decision |
| **Trust Profile** | Security level (L1/L2/L3) |
